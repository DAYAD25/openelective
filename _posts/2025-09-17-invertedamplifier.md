An inverted amplifier, also known as an inverting amplifier, is a basic operational amplifier (op-amp) configuration where the input signal is applied to the inverting (-) terminal, while the non-inverting (+) terminal is grounded. This setup produces an output that is 180 degrees out of phase with the input, effectively reversing the signalâ€™s polarity. The gain of an inverting amplifier is determined by the ratio of two resistors and can be precisely controlled, making it widely used in analog signal processing.
